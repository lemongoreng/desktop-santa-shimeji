# Desktop Santa Shimeji 🎅

**Lonely and coding alone this Christmas? Look no further!**

This is a Python-based desktop pet (Shimeji) that roams around the borders of your screen while you work. It features a frameless, transparent window that stays on top of your other applications, keeping you company during those long coding sessions.

## 🌟 Features
- **Transparent Background:** Uses Windows color keying for a seamless "sticker" look.
- **Auto-Roaming:** Santa automatically walks along the edges of your primary monitor.
- **Always on Top:** He stays visible above your IDE and browser.
- **Lightweight:** Built with standard Python libraries (`tkinter`), requiring minimal resources.
